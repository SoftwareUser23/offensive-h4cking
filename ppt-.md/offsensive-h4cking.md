` What is offensive  and defensive Hacking ? `

Offensive hacking (more correctly, offensive security) looks at ways an attacker can get in from the attacker’s perspective, often in a black box situation (i.e. not knowing any user credentials).

Defensive hacking (more correctly, defensive security), analyzes attack patterns and signatures to detect and prevent potential attacks, from the defender’s perspective (SOC analyst, incident responder, etc.) and often knowing user credentials or having more insight on the end client’s network.
